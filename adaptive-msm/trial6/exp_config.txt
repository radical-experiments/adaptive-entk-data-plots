Ensemble size = 100
1 simulation duration = 0.01ns
Number of iterations = 10
Input configuration = 25 of each configuration ('equil?.gro') at https://github.com/kassonlab/copernicus/tree/master/examples/msm/alanine-dipeptide-msm (hence 100 for 100 ensemble members)

Recluster = 1.0 ns
Macro states = 10
Micro states = 100
Simulations generated per macrostate = 10
Lag time = 2 

* The above setting creates few files: 'macro*-*.gro' (e.g. macro0-0.gro, macro9-2.gro) and 100 'new_run_*.gro' files. Apart from this the transition matrix and the eigen vector corresponding to lambda=1.
* We use the new_run*.gro as the input to the simulation in the next iteration.
* We determine the psi-phi values of the macro*-0.gro files (the number of unique psi-phi values generated is always <= size of the eigen vector).
* We plot the PMF determined from the eigen vector (lambda=1) and plot in the psi-phi space.
